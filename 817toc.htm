    <li> (4b') For any index i, use Thm 4.17 to find a nontrivial normal

   all groups of order t, up to isomorphism.
   <li> (5b) Using TOC Lemma 4.52, analyze Aut(N) for each N &isin; S.  Then

   commutative ring, 
  let h:R &rarr; S be a ring
  homomorphism, let A &sube; R[x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>], 
  and let j: {x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>}
  &rarr; S be a function satisfying the property that
  whenever  
  &sum;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup>
  r<sub>i</sub>
  x<sub>1</sub><sup>e<sub>i,1</sub></sup> ...
  x<sub>n</sub><sup>e<sub>i,n</sub></sup> &isin; A
  (with m &ge; 1 and each r<sub>i</sub> &isin; R
  and e<sub>i,j</sub> &ge; 0)
  then
  &sum;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup>
  h(r<sub>i</sub>)
  (j(x<sub>1</sub>))<sup>e<sub>i,1</sub></sup> ...
  (j(x<sub>n</sub>))<sup>e<sub>i,n</sub></sup> = 0.
   Then there is a unique
  ring homomorphism
  f: R[x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>] / (A) &rarr; S
  such that f(r+(A)) = h(r) for all r &isin; R and 
  f(x<sub>i</sub>+(A)) = j(x<sub>i</sub>) for all i.
  <li> More examples
  <li> Thm 5.124:  (<b>Homomorphism Building Theorem (HBT)
  for Group Rings</b>):
  Let R be a commutative ring with 1 &ne; 0, let G and H be groups with
  identity elements e<sub>G</sub> and e<sub>H</sub> respectively,
  and let h: G &rarr; H be a group homomorphism.  Then there is
  a unique ring homomorphism f: RG &rarr; RH satisfying
  f(g) = h(g) for all g &isin; G and f(re<sub>G</sub>) = re<sub>H</sub>
  for all r &isin; R.
