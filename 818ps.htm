that is closed under multiplication such that 1 &isin; S and 0 &#x2209; S.

<br>(a) Let I be a proper ideal of R and let
q: R &rarr; R/I be the quotient homomorphism.
Show that the adjectives "prime" and "maximal" are preserved in the
Lattice Isomorphism Theorem for Rings; that is, images and
preimages (with respect to q) of prime ideals are prime, and similarly for
maximal.
<! by showing the following:
<br>(a-i) Show that if P is a prime ideal of R containing I, then
q(P) is a prime ideal of R/I.
<br>(a-ii) Show that if Q is a prime ideal of R/I then q<sup>-1</sup>(Q)
is a prime ideal of R.

positive real root of x<sup>6</sup> - 4.

<li> <b>E9.12</b>:  This problem compares Galois groups of
extensions by n-th roots (of elements of the base field)
depending upon whether the base field contains the n-th roots of 1.
<br>
(<i>Note:</i> Since parts of this problem ask you to prove parts of
TOC Props 9.107 and 9.110, you may not use those results in your
proofs for this problem.)
<br>(a) Let p be a prime number.  
<br>(a-i) Determine the
elements of the Galois group G of x<sup>p</sup> - 2 over <b>Q</b>.
(That is, G = Gal(L/<b>Q</b>) where L is the splitting field
of x<sup>p</sup> - 2 over <b>Q</b>.)  
<br>(a-ii) Is G abelian?
<br>(b) Let F be a field and let n be
a positive integer such that char(F) does not divide n.
A <b>primitive n-th root of 1</b> over F is an element &zeta; in
the splitting field K of x<sup>n</sup> - 1 over F such that
&zeta; generates the (multiplicative) subgroup 
H := {roots of x<sup>n</sup> - 1 in K} &le; K<sup>x</sup>.
<br>(b-i) Show that |H| = n (that is, show that 
1, &zeta;, &zeta;<sup>2</sup>,...,&zeta;<sup>n-1</sup>
are distinct).
<br>(b-ii) Let b &isin; F, and let L be the splitting field of 
x<sup>n</sup> - b over F.
Show that if F contains a primitive n-th root of 1, 
then L/F is a finite Galois extension and 
Gal(L/F) is isomorphic to a subgroup of <b>Z</b>/n<b>Z</b>
and hence is cyclic.



<li> <b>E9.13</b>:  Show that <b>Q</b>(&radic;(2+&radic;(2))) / <b>Q</b>
is a Galois extension of degree 4 with Galois group that is
a cyclic group of order 4.

<li> <b>E9.14</b>:  Let q = x<sup>4</sup> -2x<sup>2</sup> -2 &isin; <b>Q</b>[x].

b<sub>1</sub> = &radic;(1 + &radic;(3)),
b<sub>2</sub> = &radic;(1 - &radic;(3)),
b<sub>3</sub> = -&radic;(1 + &radic;(3)), and
b<sub>4</sub> = -&radic;(1 - &radic;(3)).
<br>(c) Let K<sub>1</sub> := <b>Q</b>(b<sub>1</sub>), 
K<sub>2</sub> := <b>Q</b>(b<sub>2</sub>),
and F := <b>Q</b>(&radic;(3)).

are Galois over F.  
<br>(c-iii) Let G := Gal(K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub> / F).
Show that  G
is isomorphic to C<sub>2</sub> &times; C<sub>2</sub>, and write out 
(explicitly, using the number of the roots from part (b)) the
images of the elements of G under the embedding
G &rarr; S<sub>4</sub>
of TOC Thm 9.78.
Determine all of the subgroups H of G and determine their corresponding
fixed subfields (K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>)<sup>H</sup>.
<br>(d) Prove that the splitting field L of q over <b>Q</b> satisfies
[L : <b>Q</b>] = 8, and Gal(L/<b>Q</b>) is isomorphic to the dihedral group
of order 8.

<li> <b>E9.15</b>:  Let F be a field such that either char(F) = 0,
or else char(F) = p for a prime number p and F = F<sup>p</sup>
(that is, every element of F is a p-th power
of an element of F).  Prove that if K is the splitting field over F
of a (not necessarily separable) polynomial in F[x], then K/F is a
Galois extension.

<li> <b>E9.16</b>: Let K/F be a finite Galois field extension, and let b &isin; K.
Let {b<sub>1</sub>,...,b<sub>m</sub>} be the orbit of b under the action
of Gal(K/F) (with b<sub>1</sub> := b and b<sub>i</sub> &ne; b<sub>j</sub> whenever
i &ne; j).  Prove that m<sub>b,F</sub> = (x-b<sub>1</sub>) &middot;&middot;&middot;
(x-b<sub>m</sub>).  

<li> <b>E9.17</b>:  Let F be a field, let q &isin; F[x] be a separable irreducible polynomial
of degree n, let L be the splitting field of q over G, and let b be a root
of q in L.  Let K be a Galois extension of F contained in L,
and define m := [F(b) &cap; K : F] and d := [K(b) : K].
Show that the polynomial q splits into a product of m irreducible polynomials each
of degree d over K.

for the proof is given there.)
